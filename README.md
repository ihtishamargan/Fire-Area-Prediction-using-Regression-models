# Fire-Area-Prediction-using-Regression-models
Dataset has 13 different attributes and problem statement is to find a model which fits best on this model and predict area most accurately. Following is the attributes in the data:

Attribute information
X - (X-coordinate of the fire in the park: 1 to 9)
Y - (Y-coordinate of the fire in the park: 2 to 9)
month - month: ”jan“ to ”dec“)
day - (day: ”mon“ bis ”sun“)
FFMC - (FFMC index of the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.2)
DMC - (DMC index of the FWI system: 1.1 bis 291.3)
DC - (DC index of the system: 7.9 bis 860.6)
ISI - (ISI index of the FWI systems: 0.0 to 56.1)
temp - (temperature in degrees Celsius: 2.2 to 33.3)
RH - (relative humidity in %: 15 to 100)
wind - (wind velocity in km/h: 0.4 to 9.4)
rain - (rainfall in mm/m2: 0.0 to 6.4)
area - (forest area that has been burnt in hectare: 0.09 to 1090.84)

I have used 6 different kinds of Regression models:
1.  Linear regression
2. Decision trees
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Descent Regression
5. SVR
6. Neural Regression
